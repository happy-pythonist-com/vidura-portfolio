<Part 1>
I need a website for my new product called Vidura (Domain: https:://vidura.ai). THe website should use "Work Sans" as its font, and a white navbar with white background. Please use HTML, Bulma CSS & jQuery (only if required) for your needs.

The website is divided into three parts:
1. Navbar
2. Body
3. Footer

Let me explain how all three sections should look. First, with navbar.

1. Navbar

The navbar should have a white background, sufficient height and should be fixed. The navbar should initially be transperant and should get solid white background, once user starts to scroll the page. The logo is aligned on the left-most part of navbar, in the center lies three section links, namely: 1. Why Vidura AI ?, Documentation, Vidura cloud. At the right-most end, There is a "Sign in" link and "Get Started for free" button. This button should have black background and white text color. Add some padding for left-most and right-most elements. Please add some left padding to left-most and right padding to right-most elements. Also place "Why Vidura AI ? ", "Documentation", and "Vidura cloud" in the center of navbar (not next to logo) horizontally.

Once navbar coding is finished, I will start giving instructions for body.

2. Body

<section 1>
The first section of body is a row with min height of 20rem and has a center aligned heading with text "Supercharge your AI prompts with Vidura", and a subtitle of "Create ChatGPT prompts, add categories and lables to them, share it with your friends.". After the subtitle, there should be a button "Get started for free" which has black background and white text. These three elements should be vertically stacked with enough padding. I want to set a gradient background for my body with image title: "gradient.jpg",  and apply guasian blur to that image.

<section 2>
The second section of body is a row with a box with a border radius of 5 px, with a minimum height of 20rem. The box should have a background of #32302f. The box is divided into two columns of equal width. First column has a title "Prompt Engineering: an art of getting better results" and a subtitle "Prompt engineering is a new emerging domain where prompt engineers write better prompts to get quality output from AI systems." The right-side column should have a paragraph that says "Prompt engineering is applied to: " and three vertical white background boxes which display: "Text AI", "Image AI", "Sound AI" texts.  

<section 3>
The next section is to link with "Why Vidura AI ? ". The section should have a title and then paragraph following. The title is "Why Vidura AI ? " and paragraph is:

"Vidura AI is a prompt manager that manages all your prompts targeting different AI generation systems like text-to-text, text-to-image, text-to-speech, or text-to-music platforms. With one central place for your prompts, it is easy to find, label, and copy prompts. Vidura AI provides a cloud based platform where one can create an account within seconds, and start prompting. Prompts are like source code for your AI generation. One must save them, version control, and integrate with different systems.". 

Also, please fix any grammatical mistakes and re-phrase accordingly.

<section 4>
The next section should have two columns. A fixed column on the left, a scrollable column on the right.  The scrollable column on the right will scroll through different features of Vidura. Whenever a new feature is scrolled-in, the image should change to next image.

Let's say the feature list is like this:

1. Create categories
2. Beautiful prompt editor
3. Tag prompts with labels
4. Prompt efficiency rating
5. Share interesting prompts to community and earn VIdura karma points

Expand those headings with some more text. Assume we have image-1, image-2, ..., image-5 which loads into the left column when user scrolled into a feature.
